# tec-SDCC

do you know how to use the sdcc compiler ?

Yes, I do know how to use the SDCC compiler. To compile a program with SDCC, you need to use the sdcc command followed by the source file name. For example, to compile a C program named myprogram.c, you would use the command "sdcc myprogram.c". You can also use the -o option to specify an output file name, or the -c option to just compile the program without linking. 

rewrite the above for a z80 cpu.


Yes, I do know how to use the SDCC compiler for the Z80 CPU. To compile a program with SDCC for the Z80 CPU, you need to use the sdcc command followed by the source file name and the -mz80 option. For example, to compile a C program named myprogram.c, you would use the command "sdcc -mz80 myprogram.c". You can also use the -o option to specify an output file name, or the -c option to just compile the program without linking.
